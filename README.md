# County-level Socioeconomic Data for Predictive Modeling of Epidemiological Effects

**TL/DR:** We aim to gather a *machine readable* dataset related to socioeconomic factors that may affect the spread and/or consequences of epidemiological outbreaks, particularly the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This dataset is envisioned to serve the datascience and modeling communities. If you want to contribute, please let us know! You can find a list of states currently being worked on below.

**Goal:** 

We aim to collect the following information:
* Demographic data
  - Marital status
  - Kids/dependents
  - Race
  - Gender
  - Age
* Socio-economic status
* Land-use and zoning data
* Primary means of transportation
  - Public transport
  - Carpool
  - Personal vehicle (not shared)
  - Walk
  - Rideshare
* Health care system status
  - hospital beds
  - ICU beds
  - ...
* Implemented measures
  - Time of implementation

## Structure

We aggregate regional statistics on a state or county level granulariy.

Every entry in the dataset, then, could contain:


- Total number of beds
- ICU beds
- Number of emergency rooms
- Number of physicians
- Number of physician assistants
- Number of specialist assistants

## Instructions for Adding Data

Please create a new directory in [./raw_data](https://github.com/JieYingWu/disease_spread/raw_data)
with a sensible name based on the type of data you are adding.

### States In Progress
