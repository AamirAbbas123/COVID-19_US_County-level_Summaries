# Datasets

* `counties.csv` contains demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and education data for each
  county in the 50 states and Washington DC.
* `counties_order.csv` contains the FIPS codes and county name for each of these counties. FIPS
  codes are unambiguous identifiers for each county, since the same county name may appear in many
  states. See [this list](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_the_most_common_U.S._county_names)
  for examples.
