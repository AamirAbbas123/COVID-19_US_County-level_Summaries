# Datasets

Within each state directory is a file `counties.csv` which contains demographic, socioeconomic,
health care, and education data for each county in the state.

Additionally, within each county, there will be files `cases_DATE.csv`, where DATE is the date each
file was uploaded with the cases for that state. Each line in this csv file should be a case of the
COVID-19 infection, including:
* Date of infection
* Age
* Gender
* County
